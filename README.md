README file for Copylot Client Expert Advisor

Copylot Client Expert Advisor is a trade copying tool designed to copy trades from one MetaTrader terminal to another. This expert advisor allows users to copy trades from the source terminal (specified as SourceTerminal) to the target terminal (specified as TargetTerminal). 

To use this expert advisor, the following libraries must be included:

- Trade.mqh
- PositionInfo.mqh
- CopyRates.mqh
- CopyTicks.mqh

The expert advisor uses the following global variables:

- SourceTerminal: Specifies the type of the source terminal (default is 'MT5').
- TargetTerminal: Specifies the type of the target terminal (default is 'MT4').
- CopyMode: Specifies the trade copying mode (default is 1).
- MaxTerminals: Specifies the maximum number of terminals for trade copying (default is 10).

The expert advisor provides the CopyTrade() function, which defines the logic for trade copying. Within this function, trades are copied from the source terminal to the target terminal. Upon completion, a success message is printed.

The expert advisor also includes the OnInit() function, which performs initialization tasks. It checks if the source and target terminals are compatible, validates the copying mode, and ensures the number of terminals is within the allowed limit. If all checks pass, the CopyTrade() function is called. If any check fails, the initialization is deemed unsuccessful.

The OnDeinit() function is used for deinitialization tasks. It can be used to perform any necessary cleanup tasks before the expert advisor is stopped.

The OnTick() function is the main function that is executed on every tick. This function can be used to implement necessary trading functions. In the provided code, it stops the execution of the expert advisor after trade copying completion by calling ExpertRemove().
